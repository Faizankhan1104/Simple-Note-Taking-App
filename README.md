Simple Note Taking App
About This Project
Hey there! Welcome to my Simple Note Taking App. It’s a web application where you can create, view, edit, and delete notes. It’s built with React.js for the front end and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. All your notes are saved in the browser’s local storage, so you don’t lose them when you refresh the page.

What You Can Do
Add New Notes: Click the "Add Note" button to open a form where you can type in a title and description for your note.
Edit Existing Notes: Want to change something? Click the "Edit" button next to any note.
Delete Notes: Change your mind? Click "Delete" and confirm to remove the note.
Search Notes: Use the search bar to find specific notes by their title or content.
Pagination: If you have lots of notes, navigate through pages easily (10 notes per page).
Sort by Date: The most recent notes show up first.
